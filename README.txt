COLOR CALIB folder allows the user to detect the required colour on the colour chart (MACBETH colour chart). In
this analysis, the code was made to run to detect two colours on the chart which are Orange Yellow 
(#e0a32e - chart #12) and Neutral 6.5 (#a0a0a0 - chart #21). The RGB values, HSV and YCbCR values are printed. 


1. Run the color_calib.m script to automatically detect the required colours on the chart.

2. Making use the centroids positions generated by the Color Webinar toolbox, the colour Gold/Orange Yellow and 
Neutral 6.6/Gray positions on the chart were distinguished.

3. Once the position are found, the colours are marked with crosses.

4. The RGB values of the colour are determined while converting these values to HSV and YCbCr colour space.
